# COMMUNITY-DETECTION-OF-AMAZON-PRODUCT-REVIEWERS-AND-CHARACTERIZATION
More often than not, the time component of Amazon reviews is overlooked for the actual content or the characteristics of the
reviewer. This Projects motive is to  examines the relationship between timestamp of reviews, reviewers, and products in a large dataset of Amazon
reviews. Our model slices the graph into years, so that we can explore the development of Amazon user communities between 2004 and
2016. We create our graphs by generating edges between users who reviewed the same items, and we use review metadata to filter our
edges in order to create models of helpful, positive, and negative reviewers. By applying community detection to these graphs, we explore
the way these different communities grew and changed over time. We found communities around different product categories that
changed over the years according to which items were more popular at the time.

   # PROBLEM
    How might we characterize the communities of Amazon usersunder different views of theAmazon product reviews overthe time period?
   # MOTIVATION
   This project aims to better
understand Amazon reviewer
communities using graph
models that represent Amazon
reviews.
Our approach attempts to
describe and better
understand how communities
behave overtime
